With this extension, you get:

 - Validation with recommended tokens and utility classes
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Code completion
 - Context awareness
 
## Prerequisites
Before you set up the SLDS Validator, make sure that you have these essentials:
 - Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit Some features in
   Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend upon the Java Platform,
   Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). You need to have either
   version 8 or version 11 of the JDK installed.
   
   If you don’t already have version 8 or 11 of the JDK installed, you
   can install the latest version of the Java 8 JDK from [Java SE
   Development Kit 8 Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
   or the latest version of the Java 11 JDK from [Java SE Development
   Kit 11 Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html).
   
   If you also use other versions of the JDK, set your VS Code user
   setting salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.home to point to the location
   where you installed Java 8 or 11.
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) v1.26 or later
